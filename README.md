# Matrix Bot Haskell

Another ðŸ¤– for the [[matrix]](https://matrix.org) protocol written in Haskell.

This is early alpha software and as such does not implement the full suite of
features that one might normally expect from such a project.

There are two parts to this project: the _bot_ and the (HTTP) _API_ client for
[matrix]. Both components are being developed simultaniously.

## Design

* Uses ReaderT to provide runtime configuration and dependencies thoughout the API.

* The client API and the bot framework are separate to allow for these to to be
    re-used independently and to allow for custom bots using this project.

* Core library does not store state. In fact, there is no state persistence at all
    currently. This should be the default so as to preserve privacy.

* Should be blazing fast from the outset by taking advantage of the available
    Haskell concurrency features.
