# Matrix SDK Haskell
![Haskell Matrix](docs/images/haskell-matrix.svg?raw=true)

Another SDK for the [[matrix]](https://matrix.org) protocol written in Haskell.

This is early alpha software and as such does not implement the full suite of
features that one might normally expect from such a project.

There are two parts to this project: a _bot_ and the (HTTP) _API_ client for
[matrix]. Both components are being developed simultaniously but probably will
be separated in the future

## Project Status

Early Alpha.

## Dependencies

* [libolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm)

## Building

The Haskell Stack tool is the current build method. You can install this with your
package manager of choice or, you can install [Haskell Platform](https://haskell.org/platform).

```
stack build
stack install
```
This will install to ~/.local/bin but you can put the binary wherever you like (e.g. /usr/local/bin)

## Design

* Uses ReaderT to provide runtime configuration and dependencies thoughout the API.

* Monoid instance for State allowing for type-safe immutable appends of state updates

* The client API and the bot framework are separate to allow for these to to be
    re-used independently and to allow for custom bots using this project.

* Core library does not store state. In fact, there is no state persistence at all
    currently. This should be the default so as to preserve privacy.

* Should be blazing fast from the outset by taking advantage of the available
    Haskell concurrency features.
